Overview
------------

1. Executing command

Generate the AHB bus matrix RTL and determine the storing directory by running the following command:
> bin/BuildBusMatrix.pl -xmldir xml -cfg example4x8_sparse.xml -over -verbose --tgtdir=.

2. Directory

cmsdk_ahb_busmatrix/xml         - the configuration of the AHB BusMatrix (XML file)

cmsdk_ahb_busmatrix/verilog/src - AHB BusMatrix template


Introduction (ARM)
------------

This directory contains the AHB BusMatrix component.

cmsdk_ahb_busmatrix/bin/BuildBusMatrix.pl
  The AHB BusMatrix is a configurable component. The configuration
  process is handled by a Perl script, located in bin/BuildBusMatrix.pl

cmsdk_ahb_busmatrix/verilog/src
  The source code of the configurable AHB Bus matrix is located in
  verilog/src directory. Do not use the Verilog files in this directory
  directly.

cmsdk_ahb_busmatrix/verilog/built
  After configuration process, the Verilog files generated will be stored
  in verilog/built directory.

cmsdk_ahb_busmatrix/xml/
  During the configuration process, the configuration of the AHB BusMatrix
  can be controlled by command line options or by an XML file.
  Example XML files can be found in the xml directory.

cmsdk_mtx4x2/verilog/
  A preconfigured version of AHB Bus matrix for the example Cortex-M3/M4
  system is prepared in the cmsdk_mcu_mtx4x2 directory. The configuration
  of this bus matrix can be found in cmsdk_mcu_mtx4x2/xml/

Several example AHB Bus Matrix configuration XML files are provided.
You can generate the AHB bus matrix RTL by running the following command:

> cd logical/cmsdk_ahb_busmatrix
> bin/BuildBusMatrix.pl -xmldir xml -cfg example2x3_full.xml -over -verbose

Please refer to the Cortex-M System Design Kit Technical Reference Manual for
further details on the use of this component.
